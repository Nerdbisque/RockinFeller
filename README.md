# Overview

This project was for me to learn how to create and navigate through a gameframework. This particular project is a rock falling mini game
first you are greeted with a start menu making use of views in Python arcade. I wanted to learn about different softwares in the past I have worked with similar modules such as tkinter. 

To play you simply press the start button then you are greeted with a game of falling rocks and you are the space ship. You collect the rocks to acquire points and after 50 you win. Right now their is no system to check for if you win or not.

# Development Environment

To develop this software I used python arcade and Visual studio code. All programmed within the python language.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* When collision find a sound for an explosion and play an explosion png.
* make it so you have to shoot the rocks not collide points fluxuate due to that.
* I also need to add a system to check for an ending such as when a player reaches 20 rocks destroyed.
* I hope to incorporate some sort of networking within the code to allow for eitehr two player playing or interaction between them.
